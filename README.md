# Pong Game

A simple in-browser Pong game built over a couple of days to learn about HTML Canvas and practice vanilla TypeScript.

## Overview

This project is a hobby implementation of the classic Pong game, focusing primarily on Canvas manipulation and TypeScript fundamentals. The game features:

-   Classic two-player Pong gameplay
-   Configurable settings:
    -   Winning score
    -   Ball speed
    -   Paddle speed
-   Minimalist neon-styled UI
-   Countdown timer before game start

## Tech Stack

-   TypeScript
-   HTML Canvas
-   CSS
-   Vite

## Deployment

The game is automatically deployed to Vercel using GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Future Improvements (if time permits)

-   Mobile support
-   Sound effects
-   Local multiplayer scoreboard
-   Migrate to React (maybe, just for fun)

## Development

To run locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Notes

This is a learning project focused on HTML Canvas. While it includes some basic styling, the primary goal was to practice TypeScript and learn Canvas manipulation rather than create a polished UI/UX experience.
